    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish which is often reserved for
      very special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as
      Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For biryani, always use long grain rice. Basmati rice with its thin, fine
      grains is the ideal variety to use. Ghee is butter that has been slowly
      melted so that the milk solids and golden liquid have been separated and
      can be used in place of vegetable oil to yield a more authentic taste.
